# Workers' Compensation Loss Reserving Analysis

## Project Overview
Predictive modeling project for **TOU Insurance Company** to assess unpaid claim reserves for Workers' Compensation. Developed two independent actuarial models to estimate **$2.1M ultimate losses** with **less than 2% variance** between methods.

*Completed for UT Dallas Actuarial Case Competition (Oct–Nov 2025)*

---

## Objective
Estimate unpaid claim liabilities using industry-standard actuarial techniques, providing reliable reserve estimates for financial planning and regulatory compliance.

## Methods

### Method 1: Chain-Ladder Loss Development
- Constructed **paid** and **reported** loss triangles from 10+ years of claims data
- Calculated age-to-age development factors using **volume-weighted averages**
- Applied **exponential decay curve fitting** (1 + Ae^(-λt)) for tail factor estimation
- Adjusted for catastrophe outliers and inflation impacts

### Method 2: Frequency-Severity Approach
- Decomposed losses using: **E[S] = E[N] × E[X]**
  - E[N]: Ultimate claim count
  - E[X]: Ultimate average claim cost
- Developed separate triangles for claim counts and severity
- Applied trend factors to project ultimate values

## Key Findings

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Ultimate Loss Estimate | ~$2.1M |
| Model Variance | <2% between methods |
| Medical Loss Share | 53% of total reserves |
| Medical Growth Rate | Faster than indemnity losses |

### Data Challenges Addressed
- Missing data for years preceding 2010
- Catastrophic event outlier (3 years prior)
- Decreasing reported loss amounts (settlement adjustments)
- Inflation adjustments for indemnity payments

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Excel**: Data processing, triangle construction
- **Statistical Methods**: Curve fitting, weighted averages, trend analysis
